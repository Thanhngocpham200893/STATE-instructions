**Charge density difference and interface dipole moment for NO/Cu(111)**

    Thanh N. P, et al, JPCC 124, 2968 (2020)

    Charge density difference (CDD) upon the adsorption of NO is defined as
    CDD = charge (NO/Cu111) - charge (NO) - charge (Cu111).

    We seperated the adsorbed systems NO/Cu(111) into two fragments (NO and Cu(111)) 
    where two latter atomic configurations are kept fixed from the total system.

    The CDD calculation is then straightforward with two steps:

(1) **Scf calculation to get the wave function**

(2) **Valance charge density**
