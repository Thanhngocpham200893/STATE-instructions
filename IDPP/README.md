Image Dependent Pair Potential (IDPP) for improved interpolation of initial path of NEB.

IDPP provide an excellent initial path interpolation for NEB,
where bond lengths are employed to interpolate the initial images rather than simple linear interpolation.

This example provides how to use IDPP to generate an initial path for STATE code
