This tutorials discuss how to get layer-resolved-band structures (LRDOS) and K-resolved LRDOS
Here, single C is adsorbed on top of Cu(1x1) surface.

Step 1. After getting wave function and charge density from STATE code.
See nfinp_1 nfinp_2, nfinp_3
We performed LRDOS as follows
(1) Create  nfaldos.data file
(2) Change ICOND = 33 
(3) Running STATE

The aldos.data file is generated by STATE,
in which
first coluum corresponds to index of layer,
second one corresponds to the energy range,
third one corresponds to the DOS,
