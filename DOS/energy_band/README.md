**How to perform energy band structure and energy band structure projected onto adsorbate layer**

**First step is to get energy band structure**

Here I focus on spin polarization calculation <br />
(1) getting wave function and charge density from STATE by running nfinp_1, nfinp_2, and nfinp_3 <br />
(2) Prepare the k-path by using Xcrysden and prepare nfkpt.data (the units of K points is 2pi/a* 2pi/b*, 2pi/c*)
