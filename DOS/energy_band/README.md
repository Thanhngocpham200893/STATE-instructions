**How to perform energy band structure and energy band structure projected onto adsorbate layer**

**First step is to get energy band structure**

Here I focus on spin polarization calculation <br />
After getting wave function and charge density from STATE by running nfinp_1, nfinp_2, and nfinp_3 <br />
